# ðŸ“¦ Custom Evaluation Metrics for PyTorch

This lightweight Python module provides custom implementations of essential evaluation metrics for machine learning models using PyTorch tensors.

It includes both classification and regression metrics, making it suitable for testing and educational use cases.

## ðŸ“Œ Available Metrics

- `accuracy(y_true, y_pred)`
- `mae(y_true, y_pred)`
- `mse(y_true, y_pred)`
- `precision(y_true, y_pred)`
- `recall(y_true, y_pred)`
- `f1_score(y_true, y_pred)`
